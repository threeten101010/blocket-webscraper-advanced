# 🇸🇪 Blocket Web Scraper Advanced (Deep AI Listing Appraiser Pipeline)

This project is an advanced, high-performance web scraper and AI analysis pipeline designed to target Sweden's largest classifieds portal, **Blocket.se**, and execute completely remotely on your head node server over your secure Tailscale mesh network! It incorporates a deep multimodal AI appraisal system utilizing Google AI Studio.

## ⚡ Execution Models

### Model A: Direct Remote Pipeline (Recommended) 🚀
Run a single command on your Command Center:
```bash
bash run_remote.sh
```

**What this script automates:**
1. **Syncs Code**: Uses `rsync` to sync your local scraper codebase directly to your remote server (`101010_remote`), ignoring database files or virtualenvs.
2. **Prepares Host**: SSHs in, auto-creates a remote virtual environment, and resolves all pip requirements on the server.
3. **Runs Scraper**: Triggers `python3 main.py` on your remote server to run the scraper in the background (avoiding bandwidth or memory consumption on your local machine).
4. **Retrieves Data**: Downloads the updated DuckDB database `scraped_listings.duckdb` directly back to your local `data/` folder for analysis.

---

### Model B: Local Execution (Sandbox testing)
To test things locally before sending them to the server:

1. **Initialize a virtual environment & install requirements**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Trigger the run**:
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```
   *(Options: `--browser` forces headless Chromium via Playwright, default is static HTTP)*
